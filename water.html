			<ul>
				Reverse Osmosis
				<li class="indent">A special type of filtration that uses a semi-permeable membrane with pores small enough to pass pure water 
					through while rejecting larger molecules such as dissolved salts and other impurities such as bacteria.</li>
				Remineralized
				<li class="indent">The process of reverse osmosis removes all the minerals that are in our water. However, some minerals are not
					as harmful as others and our water is supposed to be an effective way for our body to absorb those minerals. We add calcium and
					magnesium back to the water that is purified via reverse osmosis. This is remineralized water.</li>
				Alkaline
				<li class="indent">Alkaline water is the exercising water of choice. This water has been proven to quickly rehydrate the body 
					during workouts. Additionally, this water has been claimed to help with digestion issues such as heartburn and there are claims
					that it hinders genetic diseases such as diabetes and even cholesterol.</li>
